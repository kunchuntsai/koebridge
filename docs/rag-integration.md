# KoeBridge RAG Integration - Phase #2 Design Document

Based on the KoeBridge Local LLM Design Document, there are several excellent opportunities to incorporate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance the translation capabilities. Here are some suitable applications for RAG in this project:

1. **Domain-Specific Terminology Enhancement**
   - The document mentions issues with specialized terminology in section 8.3 (Known Issues). RAG could help solve this by retrieving accurate translations for technical terms from domain-specific databases or glossaries when encountered during translation.

2. **Translation Customization**
   - In section 1.3 (Advanced Usage), the document discusses translation customization. RAG could allow users to provide their own reference materials (technical manuals, previous translations, etc.) which the system could query during translation to ensure consistent terminology and style.

3. **Context-Aware Translations**
   - RAG could help address the context limitations issue (8.3 Known Issues) by retrieving relevant context from previous parts of a conversation or document, improving coherence across longer translations.

4. **User Glossary and Personalization**
   - As mentioned in section 8.4 (Future Improvements), RAG could power a user glossary feature, retrieving custom translations for specific terms or phrases preferred by the user.

5. **Cultural Reference Handling**
   - When translating culturally-specific terms or references that might not translate directly, RAG could retrieve explanations or appropriate cultural equivalents.

6. **Ambiguity Resolution**
   - Japanese contains many homonyms and context-dependent interpretations. RAG could help disambiguate terms by retrieving the most likely meaning based on context examples.

7. **Field-Specific Translations**
   - For users in specific industries (legal, medical, technical), RAG could be used to access specialized translation corpora to improve accuracy in those domains.

RAG integration would fit well within the existing architecture, particularly as an enhancement to the Translation Service component described in section 4.1.3, potentially adding a new component like "Reference Knowledge Base" that could be queried during the translation procedure described in section 5.2.
