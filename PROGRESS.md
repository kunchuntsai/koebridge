## Current Progress

### Audio Capture Module âœ…
- Core audio capture implemented and tested
- Configurable audio settings
- Comprehensive test suite passes

### Translation/Model Manager ðŸ”„
Currently has basic structure in place but missing critical implementation details:

#### Missing Components
1. **Translation Model Implementation**:
   - The `GGMLModel` class has skeleton code but lacks actual implementation
   - The inference engine (`inference::InferenceEngine`) is referenced but not fully implemented
   - Tokenization/detokenization methods are declared but have no implementation
   - The `runInference` method needs a complete implementation

2. **Model Loading & Instantiation**:
   - `ModelManager::loadModel` method only updates metadata but doesn't actually load models
   - `ModelManager::getTranslationModel` returns nullptr
   - No instantiation of model classes (like GGMLModel) when models are "loaded"

3. **Model Download Functionality**:
   - `ModelManager::downloadModel` method is just a placeholder

4. **Actual Translation Logic**:
   - `TranslationService::translateInternal` returns placeholder results
   - No connection to actual translation models

5. **Integration with GGML Library**:
   - Missing actual integration with GGML library for model inference
   - No connection between model files and memory representation

6. **Threading and Performance Optimization**:
   - ThreadPool referenced but not implemented
   - No optimization for parallel inference operations

7. **Error Handling and Recovery**:
   - Basic error frameworks exist but detailed error handling is missing

8. **Configuration Integration**:
   - Model path configuration needs to be connected to config system

### Implementation Plan
Going forward, we will:
1. Continue with the Translation/Local LLM implementation (component 3)
2. Implement the Translation/Model Manager and Translation/Local LLM components together, as they share significant functionality
3. Focus on GGML integration which will address both components simultaneously
4. Complete the GGMLModel implementation as part of the LLM work

This approach is more efficient as the model loading/inference logic in ModelManager will directly support the LLM functionality.

#### Next Steps
1. Implement the actual model loading and instantiation with GGML
2. Create the complete integration with GGML library
3. Finish tokenization and inference logic
4. Add proper error handling and resource management
5. Connect the Translation Service with the Model Manager for end-to-end translation

### Translation/Local LLM ðŸ”„
- Initial integration with GGML library
- Test suite structure established
- Ongoing work to complete model inference logic
