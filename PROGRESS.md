## Implementation Order

The suggested implementation order for project components is:

1. Audio Capture Module âœ…
2. Translation/Model Manager ðŸ”„
3. Translation/Local LLM
4. Speech to Text (Whisper)
5. UI Module

## Current Progress

### Audio Capture Module âœ…
- Audio device selection and enumeration implemented
- Real-time audio capture with configurable parameters
- Audio data processing and framing
- Comprehensive test suite passes

### Translation/Model Manager ðŸ”„
Currently has basic structure in place but missing critical implementation details:

#### Missing Components
1. **Translation Model Implementation**:
   - The `GGMLModel` class has skeleton code but lacks actual implementation
   - The inference engine (`inference::InferenceEngine`) is referenced but not fully implemented
   - Tokenization/detokenization methods are declared but have no implementation
   - The `runInference` method needs a complete implementation

2. **Model Loading & Instantiation**:
   - `ModelManager::loadModel` method only updates metadata but doesn't actually load models
   - `ModelManager::getTranslationModel` returns nullptr
   - No instantiation of model classes (like GGMLModel) when models are "loaded"

3. **Model Download Functionality**:
   - `ModelManager::downloadModel` method is just a placeholder

4. **Actual Translation Logic**:
   - `TranslationService::translateInternal` returns placeholder results
   - No connection to actual translation models

5. **Integration with GGML Library**:
   - Missing actual integration with GGML library for model inference
   - No connection between model files and memory representation

6. **Threading and Performance Optimization**:
   - ThreadPool referenced but not implemented
   - No optimization for parallel inference operations

7. **Error Handling and Recovery**:
   - Basic error frameworks exist but detailed error handling is missing

8. **Configuration Integration**:
   - Model path configuration needs to be connected to config system

#### Next Steps
1. Implement the actual model loading and instantiation
2. Create the complete integration with GGML library
3. Finish tokenization and inference logic
4. Add proper error handling and resource management
5. Connect the Translation Service with the Model Manager for end-to-end translation
